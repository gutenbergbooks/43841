<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>It forms a necessary part of popular lectures that
they should possess breadth with brevity, and interest
without too great profundity. It is possible to see a
large extent of country from a lofty tower without
being cognizant of every blade of grass, the perfume of
blossoms, or the notes of the sweetest songsters of the
groves. In like manner the popular lecturer has to
present only so much to the eye of the mind as will
give the prominent features of his theme, omitting
those details over which the scholar, or the true lover
of his subject, dwells with the affection of a fond parent
over a darling child.</p>

<p>We must look with astonishment at a man of noble
birth, who in a period of civil commotion, with a
monarch for his friend, and a court at his command,
secluded himself during his youth in a stately ancient
tower, engaged in abstruse studies and wonderful mechanical
operations; and who, late in life, amidst the
terrors of civil war was found turning his inventive
faculties, like another Archimedes, to the construction
of means of defence, and terrible weapons of offence.
But it is only those who become immersed in studies,
whether of theology, philosophy, or kindred mental pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>suits,
who can appreciate the growing appetite for what
appears to unlettered men as the driest of all dry
occupations. The mere pleasure-seeker knows not
how much is lost, and how little is gained by sharing
the most brilliant gaieties of fashionable life.</p>

<p>Look at the ancient astrologers, whose pursuits were
once as pure and noble as those of modern astronomers.
Amidst wild theories, superstitious beliefs, empirical
systems, and pagan divination, a rupture became inevitable:
one side adopted stellary divination or Astrology,
the other Astronomy, or the simple and true study of
the stars.</p>

<p>Whatever a man's intellectual pursuits may be, he has
the advantage over the mere man of fashion of being
engaged in employments which the longest life cannot
exhaust.</p>

<p>But intellectual pursuits partake either of the negative
or the positive; they are useful or useless, and
when useless they fritter away and render nugatory the
talent that might have been better employed.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester affords an eminent example
of genius of a high order, grandly and effectively
directed towards the advancement of man's political and
social position. His contemporary, Dr. John Dee, the
Astrologer, together with his friend Kelly, the Alchemist,
may be appropriately distinguished as representing
a class chimerically inclined, and hurtful to the well-being
of society; while a less eminent and less blameable
section of chimerical labourers are those of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
the worst we can say is, that they waste much valuable
time, energy, and fortune, through attaching themselves
to mathematics, mechanics, and other learned pursuits,
only in search of marvellous, instead of useful
applications.</p>

<p>All chimeras are built on assumptions, and so far are
"castles in the air;" in many forms they are simply
ridiculous; but when they pretend to the supernatural
they are pernicious and often wicked.</p>

<p>In the two lectures now presented for his perusal,
the reader will find both these topics illustrated by
suitable lives and authentic evidence.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_I" id="LECTURE_I">LECTURE I.</a></h2>


<p>The Biographer of Edward, second <span class="smcap">Marquis of
Worcester</span>, naturally finds some difficulty in rendering
prominent the political position that nobleman enjoyed
in the 17th century; or of impressing the minds of
his hearers or readers with a just sense of the wonderful
genius of the author of the "Century of Inventions,"
even although the fact be established of that remarkable
man being also the true and first inventor of a
veritable steam engine.</p>

<p>When we consider the eventful period in which he
lived, (from 1601 to 1667,) and his personal character,
together with the social, political, and romantic incidents
of his life, the career of the Marquis of Worcester
cannot fail to interest and instruct us. He was at once
the most fortunate and unfortunate of men, living in
times of mingled enlightenment, superstition, and civil
discord, and finally finding himself cast on the tender
mercies of a corrupt Court; the possessor of a high
order of mechanical genius, yet proscribed politically
and theologically; most loyal, yet falling the victim of
puritanism; and closing his life neglected by a
Sovereign whose father had been the chief ruin of his
patrimony.</p>

<p>Descended from the Plantagenets, Edward Somerset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
second <span class="smcap">Marquis of Worcester</span>, is supposed to have
been born about, or soon after 1601, the records to
establish his natal year being wanting. His father,
Henry Somerset, created first Marquis of Worcester by
Charles I., was married on the 16th June, 1600, at
Blackfriars; Queen Elizabeth, attending in great state,
graciously danced at the wedding ball; and the festivities
of the occasion were continued for three days.</p>

<p>We obtain little information respecting the Marquis
of Worcester until about the twenty-seventh year of
his age, when he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
William Dormer, eldest son of Lord Dormer of Weng,
and sister of Robert, Earl of Carnarvon. It is not known
where he was educated, but it was certainly neither
at Oxford nor Cambridge. Mention is made of his
preceptor, Mr. Adams, at Raglan Castle, the baronial
seat of the lords of Raglan, in Monmouthshire. There
is every probability, however, that he finished his
education at some foreign university. His son and
heir, Henry, born in 1629, was created by Charles II.
the first Duke of Beaufort, and from him the present
Duke of Beaufort is the eighth of that rank in lineal
descent.</p>

<p>It was during the first or second year of his married
life that he engaged the services of Caspar Kaltoff,
whom he employed as a practical assistant, to work out
his numerous mechanical experiments, and whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
extols as an "unparalleled workman, both for trust and
skill."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There are still to be seen on one side of the
Keep&mdash;or citadel of Raglan Castle, the remains of
grooves in the wall, probably for the insertion of large
metal pipes, in some way or other connected with the
waterworks which are known to have been erected
there, and which were most likely carried out by
Kaltoff, under his master's directions.</p>


<p>Becoming a widower in 1635, his lordship married in
1639, his second wife, Margaret, second daughter and
co-heir of Henry O'Brien, Earl of Thomond.</p>

<p>It must have been about this period of his life that
the Marquis of Worcester made one of his most singular
and perplexing mechanical experiments, which
he exhibited at the Tower before Charles I., several
of his Court, some foreign ambassadors, and the
lieutenant of that fortress. As he names Sir William
Balfour (who held the latter appointment from 1630 to
1641) we can arrive at an approximate date. The
mechanical surprise which he states he thus presented
to gratify his royal master, was no other than a
gigantic wheel, 14 feet in diameter, weighted with
40 weights of 50 lbs. each, equal to 2000 lbs., by
means of which we are left to infer that the wheel maintained
a rotatory motion, without assistance from any
external aid whatever; that it was in fact, a realization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of that long sought for curiosity&mdash;perpetual motion.
As he wrote deliberately a statement of this circumstance
fifteen years later, or more, which he afterwards
printed, we are left without any grounds to suppose
otherwise than that he deceived himself, or was deceived,
from interested motives, by persons in his employment.
The circumstance is scarcely worth notice
except as a singular proof that such a hallucination
could exist in the mind of the same genius that
perfected the first practical steam-engine. We can
only say that if the mystery could be cleared up, although
it would be of little or no value to mathematics
or mechanics, it would go far to elevate the scientific
character of the Marquis, though he was not the only
celebrity of his time infatuated with a thorough belief
in the possibility of solving the paradox.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester, born at the close of
Queen Elizabeth's reign, is not mentioned as appearing
at the Court of James I; his courtier life most likely
commenced later, in the reign of Charles I, who was
about his own age, and with whose career, the fortunes
of both the Marquis of Worcester, and his father,
family, and friends, were unhappily but too intimately
interwoven.</p>

<p>It requires a visit to Raglan Castle fully to realise
the grandeur, nobleness, and strength of that romantically
situated, and almost regal stronghold. It wears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
all the solemnity that antiquity can bestow, it is
so gothic, so solid, and embowered, as it were, in a
constant dubious shade. Then it is so extensive in its
bounds, its apartments are so capacious, and its massy
walls so lofty and so finely chiseled and proportioned,
that when we consider there is no quarry within any
reasonable distance, nor any river or stream for conveyance,
the whole structure assumes the mystery of
absolute romance. Its historic associations also rivet
the attention of every beholder who is acquainted with
the part it played in determining the fate of that great
struggle between the Crown and the Parliament, which
commenced in 1640, and ended with the establishment
of a Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The county of Monmouth is eminently distinguished
for its scenery, its green hills and dales presenting
a beautifully wooded and highly picturesque landscape
from every point of view. The village of Raglan
is a small unpretending hamlet, principally remarkable
for its parish church, which contains the chapel
of the Beauforts, the resting place of several members of
the Somerset family. Peering above lofty neighbouring
trees, the Donjon, Keep, or Citadel of Raglan
Castle is a conspicuous object; itself very lofty and
standing on a considerable eminence, it commands a
most delightful and extensive panoramic view of the
surrounding country in that fertile district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The Castle may be described as consisting of two
portions, distinguished by two courts and two fortified
arched entrances. The grand entrance, between two
hexagonal towers, leads to the paved court, with the
closet tower or library to the right, a withdrawing or
ball-room overhead, and a banqueting or stately hall to
the left, which last apartment attracts much notice
from its great size and remarkable state of preservation.
Externally situated is the Citadel or Tower of Gwent,
surrounded with a broad moat over which there appears
to have been a drawbridge on one side, and on the
other, adjoining the castle a permanent stone bridge.</p>

<p>During his youth, the Marquis of Worcester, as Lord
Herbert, resided at the Castle, and may have had his
laboratory, workshop, and study conveniently situated
in the Citadel; at all events, in connection with his
early career, the ruined remains of the family mansion
cannot be visited without intense interest. His father
was a noble minded, hearty, generous man, living in
princely state; an extensive and wealthy landed
proprietor, and in case of need capable of defending
his Citadel against any foe whatever. This last
necessity made itself conspicuous between the years
1640 and 1641, when the civil war broke out. After
the fatal battle of Naseby, 14th June, 1645, Charles I.
three times rested at the Castle, staying there in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>twenty-seven days. The strength of that fortress
enabled it to resist the Parliamentary arms longer than
any other stronghold&mdash;its surrender following very
shortly after that of Pendennis Castle.</p>

<p>When civil war was raging in this country, when
King and Parliament were in opposition, when Puritan,
Protestant, and Papist sought for mastery, when
cavaliers met roundheads in mortal conflict, and every
man stood in fear of his neighbour, the Marquis of
Worcester could no longer remain a mere student of
mechanism and of mathematical problems: if like
Archimedes in one sense, he was now seen, unlike him,
buckling on his armour, raising troops, and doffing the
student's gown to become the soldier. Alas! his
military career forms no brilliant page in the annals of
his country's history. He was essentially neither a
statesman, nor a military man. He was bold, courageous,
and energetic, but he could neither be fierce nor
ferocious on occasion. He tampered with opponents,
lost means of surprise, and was ever being tricked by the
cunning and chicanery of adversaries not over-scrupulous
in their promises or proceedings. His very goodness
of heart, urbanity and uprightness were the sources
of his utter ruin. Himself incapable of deceit, he was
perpetually being made the victim of it: those who
appeared his assured friends, and had every reason to
be so, proving in any emergency shallow, empty, and
worthless. Flattered by Charles I. he became instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>mental
in assisting that Prince from his parent's
private fortune; and when that was exhausted, the
King sapped the property of the son, repaying both
with titles, promises, and valueless bonds. He created
the Marquis of Worcester Earl of Glamorgan, during
his father's life-time; and, inducing him to raise Irish
troops to fight against English subjects, he completed
the Earl's ruin; for, that untoward enterprise
failing, and being followed by the fall of Raglan
Castle, and the victories of the Cromwellian army,
the Marquis of Worcester had to quit his native
land to seek refuge, with many other political refugees,
at the Court of France. His wife, who had been
residing at Raglan Castle, obtained leave from the
Parliament in 1646 to flee to Paris, where the Marquis
also arrived in 1648.</p>

<p>The Marquis was proscribed both as a Papist and a
rebel. Throughout his political career the religion of
his father and himself had made many weak-minded
men their enemies; but that his loyalty should be
considered rebellion was nothing more than might be
expected from the dominant party of those troubled
times: although undoubtedly the result of that great
moral earthquake benefited our nation.</p>

<p>His only son, Henry, sat in the Cromwellian Parliament,
and this fact may, in part, explain the circumstance
that most probably induced the Marquis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Worcester to visit London in 1652; for he must have
been well-advised before committing such an apparently
rash act. He was immediately incarcerated in the
Tower, from which he was released in two years and a
quarter, no doubt on his parole, as in 1655 a warrant was
signed by Cromwell to pay the Marquis of Worcester
the sum of <i>three pounds per week</i> for his maintenance.</p>

<p>He was utterly beggared; what was he to do? It
seems to have occurred to him to turn his mechanical
ingenuity to account, the Pretender's monetary consideration
being insufficient for the purpose intended.
This high-minded nobleman in the same year wrote his
remarkable "Century of Inventions," although it was
not printed until eight years afterwards. The title-page
declared its production to have been "at the instance
of a powerful friend," who was, as we have reason
to think, no other than Colonel Christopher Coppley,
or Copley, who had served in the Parliamentary army
of the North, under the command of General Fairfax;
for agreements were drawn up between them to secure
a participation in any benefits arising from introducing
the steam engine, or water-commanding
engine, as it was then called.</p>

<p>It is not to the historic page, but to the calm unobtrusive
volumes of scientific record, that we must turn
to be enlightened with respect to the mental and
mechanical achievements of the Marquis of Worcester;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and we must at the same time not overlook the fact,
that many branches of science were, in his day, but
just emerging from that thraldom of empiricism,
which had for centuries clouded every department of
philosophical research.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester was so essentially a
scientific, and not a literary man, that Horace
Walpole acted most inconsistently in classing him
among his <i>Royal and Noble Authors</i>. That brilliant
cynic, however, had a purpose to serve, and although
he found in the Marquis a vein of pursuit of which he
was totally ignorant, he presumed to criticise the
"Century," and to question its author's veracity;
a charge which, if established, even in a minor degree,
would serve a political purpose, by proving the Marquis
to be unreliable in other respects, and thus weakening
his authority in religion and politics. But the dilettante
Walpole, a connoisseur in paintings and works of <i>vertu</i>,
was, in matters of science, more ignorant of the Marquis
of Worcester's worth, than was the equally
satirical Voltaire of Shakspeare's genius. Hume, the
historian, attracted by the sparkling wit of Walpole,
adopted without examination, his plausible criticism,
unconscious of its superficiality and absolute untruthfulness
in every respect.</p>

<p>We would here notice the probable cause of the
Marquis's indefatigable study of, and attention to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
practical mechanics. As in the time of Charles II., so
also during the reign of his father, there is reason to
believe that some distinguished public officer was
appointed to superintend Government works connected
with the army and navy, and that they were situated
at Vauxhall. It was probably a department similar to
that held in 1661, by Sir Samuel Morland, designated
Master of Mechanics. Otherwise how are we to account
for the Marquis of Worcester's devoting his time, his
energies, and his very fortune to inventions affecting
mechanical appliances generally, and particularly to
those connected with naval and military affairs, and
hydraulic engines?</p>

<p>One of his inventions (No. 56) he exhibited to Charles
I. at the Tower, and of another (No. 64) being an
improvement in fire-arms, he observes it was "tried
and approved before the King (Charles I.), and an
hundred Lords and Commons." Then his great invention,
the "Water-commanding Engine," was set up at
Vauxhall in 1663, where it was certainly at work in
1667, or probably three years later. All these circumstances
wear the aspect of royal patronage, of public
employment, and of the possession of influence suitable
to the holder of a dignified position.</p>

<p>This view of the high and honourable public
official position held by the Marquis is also borne out
by the petition of William Lambert, about 1664, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
be found in the State Paper Office. It was addressed
to Charles II. and sets forth:&mdash;"That your petitioner
was founder to his late Majesty of blessed memory,
in Vauxhall, under the Marquis of Worcester, for
gun and water-work, or any other thing founded in
brass." Nothing surely can be more certain than
that the Marquis's was a public situation, and his
"Century" affords ample evidence of his aptitude in
<i>that</i> respect for the post which he filled; nor can
we better account for his numerous improvements in
fire-arms, cannon, sailing vessels, fortifications, and
embankments.</p>

<p>His "Century of Inventions" is the mere syllabus or
outline of a proposed larger work, for he concludes
with the statement of his&mdash;"meaning to leave to
posterity a book, wherein under each of these heads
the means to put in execution and visible trial all and
every of these inventions, with the shape and form of
all things belonging to them, shall be printed by brassplates,"&mdash;the
usual substitute at that time for copperplates.
It is most unfortunate that he did not live to
complete his projected publication. But in common
candour let it not be forgotten that, the promise
thus placed before us was published in 1663, not long
before the devastating plague, which almost depopulated
the metropolis in 1665, and the terrible
conflagration of 1666, which laid waste the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
London; and that it was in the midst of the accumulated
calamities thus inflicted on society, that his health
appears to have suddenly given way; aged, harassed,
disappointed, and dismayed, he was prematurely called
to his long rest on the 3rd of April, 1667; but whether
he died at Vauxhall, at the family town mansion, Worcester
House, in the Strand, or at some other place is
unknown; so little was he understood or esteemed for
his intellectual capacity at the period of the Restoration.
As though it were not a sufficient infliction to be ruined,
dishonoured, oppressed, and neglected while living, it
would almost appear that events conspired to lessen, if
possible, the lustre of his memory by the dark shades
of apocryphal history; which ascribed the invention of
the steam-engine to the pretended fact of the Marquis
while in imprisonment, having seen a pot lid blown off
by the expanding steam; made out against him a false
case of political forgery; and, worse than all, scandalously
forged a letter in Paris to make it appear that in
1641 the Marquis borrowed his idea of the steam
engine from Salomon De Caus, during a visit to the
Bicêtre, at Paris. The fact that this same De Caus
died at Paris, and was buried in the Church of La
Trinité, in February, 1626;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> shows how requisite it is
for rogues to remember historical dates.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June, in 1663, the Parliament passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
an Act securing to the Marquis of Worcester the full
benefit and profit of his "Water-commanding Engine,"
for the term of ninety-nine years. And in the same
year he printed his memorable "Century," in the
Dedication of which he alludes to the above Act, as
one by which he feels "sufficiently rewarded."</p>

<p>The "Century" is little more than a Catalogue
Raisonné, although each matter of invention is as fully
and intelligibly stated as was required in the Patent
office specifications of the period. To give some idea
of its contents, we shall enumerate only the first
twenty-five. 1. Seals abundantly significant; 2.
private and particular to each owner; 3. a one
line cipher; 4. reduced to a point; 5. varied significantly
to all the 24 letters; 6. a mute and perfect
discourse by colours; 7. to hold the same by
night; 8. to level cannon by night; 9. a ship-destroying
engine; 10. how to be fastened from aloof
and under water; 11. how to prevent both; 12.
an unsinkable ship; 13. false destroying decks;
14. multiplied strength in little room; 15. a boat
driving against wind and tide; 16. a sea-sailing fort;
17. a pleasant floating garden; 18. an hour-glass
fountain; 19. a coach-saving engine; 20. a balance
waterwork; 21. a bucket fountain; 22. an ebbing
and flowing river; 23. an ebbing and flowing castle
clock; 24. a strength increasing spring; and 25. a
double drawing engine for weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>We find in the "Century" that three of the articles
refer to improved seals and watches; two to games;
two to arithmetic and perspective; six to automata, or
self-acting mechanical contrivances; no less than
twenty-three to ciphers, correspondence, and signals:
in short, secret writing and telegraphs; ten to useful
appliances in domestic affairs; nine are wholly mechanical;
upwards of thirty-two were intended for use in naval
and military affairs; and thirteen, including his Water-commanding
Engine, were connected with hydraulics.
It is singular that he professes "to have <i>tried and
perfected</i> all these," words of great import in all
matters of novel invention.</p>

<p>That age was fond of patronizing what we should
now-a-days be disposed to call "nic-nacs." Ingenious
automata, curious toys and works of art, small fountains,
singing birds, and similar curiosities attracted
the serious attention of the virtuosi of the 17th century;
so that we need not feel surprised that the Marquis
set up a speaking Brazen Head; or that it should be
of gigantic proportions, for he was always regardless of
cost in such matters, and was never small where he
could be great in developing his resources of ingenious
contrivance. Wherever it was possible, he was magnificent&mdash;fortifications,
embankments, ships rowing
against wind and tide, great floating baths, and
gardens, large cannon, in short, he was princely in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
expenditure of his private fortune on whatever he
undertook to perform, whether in war or in peace. It
was thus he spent, lent, and lost for his King and
country £918,000. He particularly notices that he
laid out on buildings and experiments at Vauxhall, the
sum of £59,000. But these items are far from representing
his actual expenditure, although they indicate
the scale of his operations; and taken at their value
two centuries back such sums manifest marvellous
munificence.</p>

<p>We have no certain key to any of his inventions, if
we except two specimens of his cipher writing. One
exists in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and there is a deciphered
letter in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>


<p>His noblest invention, that which must for ever
embalm his memory in the breasts not alone of Englishmen,
but of all classes throughout the civilized world,
was in operation at Vauxhall from 1663 to 1667, during
his life time, and appears to have been working as
late as 1670. It was ordered by the Act granted
him, "that a model thereof be delivered to the Lord
Treasurer or Commissioners for the Treasury for the
time being, at or before the 29th of September, 1663;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and to be put into the Exchequer, and kept there."
And in the 98th article of the "Century," alluding to
this same engine he says&mdash;"I call this a <i>semi</i>-omnipotent
engine, and do intend that a model thereof be
buried with me." Yet, strange to say, neither the one
model nor the other, although zealously searched for,
has come to light: and so little attention did this
invention, notwithstanding its surprising utility,
excite in the 17th century, that all the account we
have of it, besides that by the inventor himself, is
the briefest possible notice given by two foreign
travellers, Sorbière in 1663-4, and Cosmo the third,
Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1669. It is satisfactorily
ascertained, however, that upwards of seventeen
persons, all living in 1663, were more or less
acquainted with the Marquis's mechanical operations
at Vauxhall, and must have seen the great water-engine
at work, if only as a novelty, and a matter of curiosity.</p>

<p>Returning to the "Century of Inventions," we find
it to be a journal of the fruits of its noble author's
study of mechanical philosophy for nearly forty years,
so that in it we may almost trace the youth and age of
his mental capacity. Viewed through a modern
medium we might feel disposed to discredit the genius
of a man who could contrive so many curious alphabets
for secret writing as those he mentions, but such
systems were extensively practised in political and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
private correspondence during the Civil war period
to baffle the curiosity of political opponents. What
may be called mechanical tricks were also much in
vogue, such as singing and flying birds, artificial
figures and horses, and curiously contrived watches,
cabinets, locks, and keys. Unless we bear in mind the
taste of the age, we shall read with surprise such an
announcement as the following, in the 88th article in
the "Century":&mdash;</p>

<p>"How to make a brazen or stone head, in the midst
of a great field or garden, so artificial and natural, that
though a man speak never so softly and even whispers
into the ear thereof, it will presently open its mouth,
and resolve the question in French, Latin, Welsh,
Irish, or English, in good terms uttering it out of his
mouth, and then shut it until the next question be
asked."</p>

<p>No doubt the Marquis had in mind the history of
the renowned Brazen Head attributed to Friar Bacon.
The authors of the works on mechanical subjects
published down to the 17th century, did not disdain
to describe the way to manufacture automatic men,
animals, and birds, with suitable joints, springs,
weights, and bellows; and therefore, the Marquis did
really no more than express the character of the times,
without lowering his own superior intelligence. He
was seeking the patronage of royalty, parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and the public, and if he offered occasionally such
trifles as commanded the attention of the multitude, he
never in the whole course of his chequered life lost
sight of his more important occupations, the conceptions
of a mind far in advance of that dismal and dark
period. At the same time, that his age neglected to
uphold applied science, and pertinaciously opposed
whatever appeared to savour of innovation on time-honoured
manufactures and trades, we cannot overlook
the anomalous fact that it gave birth to Shakspeare,
Bacon, and Milton; Sir Thomas Brown, Wallis, Hook,
Newton, and Boyle, together with a brilliant constellation
of luminaries who adorned every department of
our general literature. Science alone stagnated, and the
construction of public works was chiefly conducted
by foreign aid. The establishment of the Royal
Society in 1660, however, gave promise of that improvement
which has steadily gone on year by year to the
present day.</p>

<p>We have thus before us a broad outline of the
Marquis of Worcester's birth, education, studies, and
scientific pursuits. His tastes and employments were
not suited to a successful political or military career,
at a time when the rupture between the Crown and the
Parliament rendered it necessary for every man to
take the side either of the Cavaliers or the Roundheads.
Both father and son displayed unbounded loyalty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
although professing the Roman Catholic faith. Had
they, like many other noble families, adopted the policy
of taking opposite courses, the family might eventually
have retained estates which were forfeited when the
King was deposed, and were principally enjoyed by
Cromwell. Raglan Castle was demolished, all that
could be carried away was sold, the strong tower or
citadel was partially blown up, its ditch left dry, and
all that could be most readily spoiled was mutilated,
even to the marble and alabaster monuments in
Raglan Church, raised to the memory of ancestors of
the family. Such ruthless destruction and pillage has
failed, however, to obliterate the towers, walls, arches,
chambers, and numerous vaults of that once princely
residence.</p>

<p>From the year 1601 to 1641, (forty years of his
life) was a period to which he refers as his "Golden
Age" in the dedication of his "Century." While that
from 1641 to 1647-8, (when he fled from Ireland to
France,) was the most exciting, exhausting, and disastrous
of his whole existence, and closed with utter ruin
to himself and his family. He had then living his
second wife, Henry, his son and heir, and two
daughters. The family town mansion, Worcester
House in the Strand, partly used as a State Paper
Office, was eventually granted to the Marchioness of
Worcester for her residence. The wearisomeness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
distress attendant on his residence as a refugee in
France during four years, was embittered by above
two years imprisonment in the Tower, the result of his
venturing to revisit London while proscribed by the
Parliament as "an enemy and traitor to the Commonwealth,"
all such being threatened that they shall "die
without mercy, whenever they shall be found within
the limits of this nation." Burton, in his interesting
Diary of Oliver Cromwell's Parliament, says in reference
to the case of the Marquis on this occasion:&mdash;"It was
urged he was an old man, had lain long in prison, and
the small-pox then raging under the same roof where
he lay; and he had not, as was said, done any actions
of hostility, but only as a soldier; and in that capacity
had always shown civilities to the English prisoners
and Protestants. It was therefore ordered that he
should be bailed out of prison." He was probably
then about fifty-three years of age, but so harassed and
so worn down by fatigue that he might well appear to
be a prematurely "old man." He was not, however, too
old to write his "Century" in 1655, and to re-write
and publish it in 1663; to apply for and obtain an Act
of Parliament for his great invention of a steam water-raising
engine; and to get a working engine set up at
Vauxhall, and project a public company for obtaining
funds sufficient to extend its utility to the supply of
towns, and canals, and for draining mines and marsh
lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marquis of Worcester was sincerely impressed
with the capabilities and great value of his invention;
and it affords a striking proof of his high estimation
and correct knowledge of the magnitude of his
discovery, that he should have bowed himself before his
Maker in humble adoration, acknowledging in a
solemnly sublime strain his sense of obligation to the
Supreme Source of all intelligence, for permitting him
to become instrumental in the development of so great
a mystery of nature. It is so short and significant
that no apology can be required for quoting it
entire:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>The Lord Marquis of Worcester's ejaculatory and
extemporary thanksgiving prayer when first with
his corporal eyes, he did see finished a perfect trial
of his Water-commanding Engine, delightful and
useful to whomsoever hath in recommendation either
knowledge, profit, or pleasure.</i></p></div>

<p>"Oh! infinitely omnipotent God whose mercies are
fathomless, and whose knowledge is immense and inexhaustible,
next to my creation and redemption I
render Thee most humble thanks even from the very
bottom of my heart and bowels, for thy vouchsafing
me (the meanest in understanding), an insight in so
great a secret of nature beneficial to all mankind, as
this my Water-commanding Engine. Suffer me not to
be puffed up, O Lord, by the knowing of it, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
more rare and unheard of, yea unparalleled inventions,
trials, and experiments, but humble my haughty heart,
by the true knowledge of my own ignorant, weak, and
unworthy nature, prone to all evil. O most merciful
Father, my Creator, most compassionating Son, my
Redeemer, and Holiest of Spirits, the Sanctifier, three
Divine persons and one God! grant me a further concurring
grace with fortitude to take hold of thy goodness,
to the end that whatever I do, unanimously and
courageously to serve my king and country, to
disabuse, rectify, and convert my undeserved, yet wilfully
incredulous enemies, to reimburse thankfully my
creditors, to remunerate my benefactors, to re-enhearten
my distressed family, and with complacence
to gratify my suffering and confiding friends
may, void of vanity or self-ends, only be directed to thy
honour and glory everlastingly. Amen."</p>

<p>Judging of the Marquis of Worcester's personal
appearance from two family portraits, one when he
was probably about twenty-five years of age, by Vandyck;
the other when between forty and fifty years
old, by Hanneman; he must have been rather of a
delicate frame, and in stature somewhat under the
average height; his face oval, with sharp bright eyes,
and wearing a cheerful benignant aspect. His dress
was, of course, the costume of the period of Charles
the Second's reign, but its character has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
observed in either of the portraits just named, one of
which represented him in armour, and the other, as was
not then unusual with artists, attired as a Roman general.
We infer that he laboured under a defect in his
speech, from his remarking in a memorial addressed to
the King that he penned it&mdash;"To ease your Majesty of
a trouble incident to the prolixity of speech, and a
<i>natural defect of utterance</i> which I accuse myself of."
It might be interesting to speculate how his sense of
deficiency in physical strength, in eloquence of speech,
and volubility of language might have contributed
to the fostering of that disposition for intense application
to scientific studies which became to him like
a second nature.</p>

<p>During the first two years of the Restoration, the
Marquis was in pretty regular attendance on his Parliamentary
duties. In 1661, he was obliged to seek protection
so that proceedings might not be taken against
him by his creditors; and about the same time his forfeited
estates were restored to him, but so encumbered
and impoverished as to yield him a very insufficient income,
if any. It was in the midst of such distractions
as these that this talented inventor and noble benefactor
to his species had to maintain his social position;
and, at the same time, endeavour to convince the
bigoted age in which he may be said rather to have
existed than to have flourished, that he was master of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
a power of such magnitude for the abridging of
human labour, as the mind of man had never before
conceived.</p>

<p>It may be freely conceded that, <i>stupendous</i> as he
himself pronounced the parent engine to be, it was but
as the acorn compared to the time-honoured monarch
of the forest. Just as the existence of the plant is
dependent on that of the seed, so if the Water-commanding
Engine, the great Fire Water-work he
constructed had never existed, we might have been unacquainted,
to this day, with the mechanical application
of steam, and should have been deprived in consequence
of the manifold blessings it bountifully bestows on
mankind.</p>

<h3>ADDENDUM.</h3>

<p>Evidence of the Marquis of Worcester's claim to the
Invention of the Steam Engine.</p>

<p>1. His personal claim to have written a statement
respecting it in 1655; his MS. being afterwards lost.</p>

<p>2. The Act of Parliament<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which was granted him
for the term of ninety-nine years, and which received
the royal assent on the 3rd June, 1663.</p>

<p>3. His "Century of Inventions," printed from a re-written
copy of his lost notes of 1655; and which names
in the Dedication, the granting of the above Act.</p>

<p>The following list<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> comprises upwards of seventeen
persons all living in 1663:&mdash;</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Caspar Kaltoff</span>, a confidential workman, engaged
by the Marquis as his engineer in 1628, who died
about 1664, and is honourably mentioned in the
"Century."</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Martha Kaltoff</span>, wife of Caspar Kaltoff, who is
named in letters patent dated 1672, <i>as lately deceased</i>.
Her family was&mdash;</p>


<ul><li><span class="smcap">Catharine</span>, married to Claude Denis.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Caspar Kaltoff</span>, and his unmarried sister&mdash;</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Isabel Kaltoff</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Peter Jacobson</span>, a sugar refiner, who married one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of Kaltoff's daughters, had a portion of the buildings at
Vauxhall, where the Water-commanding Engine was
erected, and in operation from 1663, till at least to the
year 1669, if not some years later.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">William Lambert</span>, another workman, a founder at
Vauxhall, in the reign of Charles I., "under the
Marquis of Worcester, for gun and waterwork, or any
other thing founded in brass," in 1647, and who was
living in 1664-5.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Christopher Copley</span>, who had been a Colonel in
the Parliamentary service, and was probably an iron
master, having been the proprietor of four Iron Works.
He assisted the Marquis at an early period and held a
pecuniary interest in his invention of a Water-commanding
Engine. Indeed it is highly probable that he
was the "powerful friend" at whose instigation the
"Century" was written in 1665.</p>

<p>9. The <span class="smcap">Earl of Lotherdale</span>, written to in January,
1660, had a copy of the "Definition" of the Engine
sent to him, and is promised an ingeniously contrived
box or cabinet. He was appointed as late as March,
1665, to be one of a Commission to report on the
affairs of the Marquis, and must, therefore, have been
familiar with all matters relating to the noble inventor.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Dr. Robert Hook</span>, the eminent mathematician,
was acquainted with Caspar Kaltoff, and early in 1667,
went purposely to see the engine working at Vauxhall,
having read the "Definition."</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">The Honourable Robert Boyle</span> received from
Dr. Hook a copy of the "Definition," sent to him with
a letter on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Lord Brereton</span> is specially mentioned by Dr.
Hook, as being so confirmed in his doubts of the
excellence of the Marquis's engine, that he had laid a
wager on the subject.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">Henry Somerset</span>, Lord Herbert, afterwards
created first Duke of Beaufort, by Charles II., must
have frequently seen the engine in operation. He
died in 1699.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap">James Rollock</span>, who wrote a poetic eulogy on
the Engine about 1663, speaks of himself as "an
ancient servant," having known his lordship forty
years, dating back to 1623.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>


<p>15. <span class="smcap">Samuel Sorbière</span> visited the works at Vauxhall,
and published particulars of the engine he saw there in
1663.</p>

<p>16. <span class="smcap">Lord John Somerset</span>, the Marquis's eldest
brother, appears latterly to have lived at Vauxhall,
according to a warrant dated September, 1664; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
would certainly be admitted into his brother's confidence.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap">Cosmo the Third</span>, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in his
Diary exactly describes the engine he saw at Vauxhall
in 1669, "considered to be of <i>greater service to the
public</i> than the other machine near Somerset House."</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap">Walter Travers</span>, a Roman Catholic priest, names
the engine in a letter which he wrote to the Dowager
Marchioness of Worcester, in 1670.</p>

<p>19. <span class="smcap">Dr. Thomas Sprat</span>, F.R.S., published in 1665,
a critical work on "M. Sorbière's Voyage into
England," and could not therefore be ignorant of the
Marquis's engine, as it was named by the French
traveller, although Sprat omitted to notice it specially
in his own "Observations."</p>

<p>20. Among his other contemporaries were Sir
Samuel Morland, Dr. Wallis, Sir Christopher Wren,
Sir Isaac Newton, and many more, who, however, (so
far as is at present known,) are silent in regard to all
matters relating to the Marquis.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The present Lecture, embodying a variety of subjects,
under the general title of <span class="smcap">Chimeras of Science</span>,
not only reviews them in succession, but expresses
sentiments with regard to each which result from a
long acquaintance with ancient and modern scientific
authors; supported by an experimental, and, not unfrequently,
by a practical acquaintance with several
branches of natural philosophy. The consequence of
this intimacy with various scientific studies, has been a
thorough conviction of the necessity of possessing a
knowledge of elementary principles, before professing
a belief in new doctrines, whose only recommendation
is their novelty, extravagance, and inutility. Without
absolutely pretending to any golden road, or short
path to learning, superficial but ambitious scholars are
the first to seize on first impressions, build up some
grand theory, lay down certain postulates, seek
proselytes, and display a wonderful amount of enthusiasm
in creating systems which, however beautiful
in appearance, can boast of no solid foundation.
Imperfectly educated, and shallow, but not unfrequently
highly imaginative, men, if not themselves
absolute charlatans, are the easily led dupes, who become
the admirers and abettors of every "new wind
of doctrine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Every age has been sensational. Man delights in
mystery, and mysticism is a certain sign of imperfect
knowledge. A classic age was not proof against the
tricks and deceitful practices of the oracles, soothsayers
and jugglers. The dark ages only served to
keep alive the human desire for sensation; and less
than a century ago, poor, simple, half idiotic women,
were burnt at the stake as witches. The Mahometans
had their prophet, and so have the Mormons.
Mesmer had his disciples, and so have many modern
Spiritualists. The Astrologer of the 17th century,
is presented to us in a modern dress by the seer
Zadkiel. Jacob Behmen and Emanuel Swedenborg,
but represent a class that is continually dying out, yet
is as continually reproduced; the authors of pious
romances, theological enigmas, scientific spiritualisms,
and spiritualized transcendental philosophisms. Swedenborg
introduces us to the inhabitants of the moon;
they are short, the size of a youth of seven years of age;
and they speak with a thunderous voice for want of
an atmosphere, and not from the mouth, but from the
abdomen! But many persons admire such wanderings
of a pretended inward and prophetic light.</p>

<p>There are still living a few faithful believers in
<i>Alchemy</i>, who earnestly look forward to the coming of
the day when the grand, the glorious secret, shall be fully
revealed; not, however, to the vulgar crowd, but to the
noble, true, and virtuous adept,&mdash;to him, and him only.</p>

<p>A class of <i>Mathematicians</i> still continues to publish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
papers and pamphlets on squaring, cubing, and trisecting.
On this subject, the reader might find some
amusement in the critiques of Professor De Morgan,
who wrote several papers in the <i>Athenæum</i>, 1865, under
the title of <i>A Budget of Paradoxes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mechanics</i> are still living who firmly believe in the
possibility of realizing a mechanical perpetual motion,&mdash;to
spin, pump, or drive carriages or machinery, by
means of a constantly descending weight. And, year
by year, many such schemes, find their final resting
place in the archives of the Patent Office.</p>

<p>It is melancholy to reflect on the waste of mental
energy, inflicted on society by such vanities as Astrology,
Alchemy, and their kindred empirical employments.
Look at the centuries wasted, and worse than
wasted, in studying such intellectual abortions, and in
writing thousands of volumes of inanity to uphold falsehood
and delude the unwary. What the sword has
done physically, the pen and the wand of the sorcerer
have done mentally, in prostrating the intellectuality
of mankind.</p>

<p>It would tend to promote the progress of society at
large, if education were so far general that the acquirements
of the middle and lower classes should act on
the upper classes as a stimulant to the pursuit of those
higher branches of study, which mostly fall to the lot
of the nobility and men of fortune: whose birth and
ample means otherwise relieve them from all incitements
other than such as are fostered by the necessities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of public office. With title and fortune, and no ambition
to hold public employment, any education is
thought to be sufficient that serves to obtain the usual
dignities, and to give that polish which completes the
accomplished gentleman. To the spread of education
alone, can we look with any reliance for the downfall,
or at least the diminishing of the hold on the human
mind which Chimeras of every order usurp in our own,
in common with every other country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHIMERAS_OF_SCIENCE" id="CHIMERAS_OF_SCIENCE">CHIMERAS OF SCIENCE.</a></h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Although the present lecture seems to require
some introductory remarks, they must necessarily be
brief&mdash;our time being limited and this discourse
rather discursive; yet it is sufficiently condensed to
suit the present occasion, and illustrates fully the
truthfulness of the axiom that&mdash;<i>A little learning is a
dangerous thing</i>: from its tendency to inspire its possessors
with vanity rather than with the humility which
always accompanies profound knowledge.</p>

<p>You are no doubt all, or most of you, well acquainted
with the use made of Astrology and Alchemy in the
dramas of Shakspeare&mdash;"The Antiquary" of the
"Wizard of the North"&mdash;the "Strange Story" of Lord
Lytton&mdash;the "Faust" of Goëthe; and are probably familiar
with the more instructive works of Scott on Demonology,
and of Brewster on Natural Magic. Now we
always find that fiction is more suitable than truth for
romantic writings; truth is circumscribed, but the
fictions whether of Astrology, Alchemy, or any other
pseudo-philosophy are erratic, the delight of poets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
romance writers, being the comets and <i>ignes fatui</i> of
many popular compositions in our light literature.</p>

<p>There is no end of fabulous writings of the class we
call novels and romances, and no end of deceptions
which we patronize as tricks of legerdemain; the one
gratifies our imagination and fancy, the other takes our
common sense by surprise; but all these are harmless
because only presented to us for our amusement.</p>

<p>Delusion, however, assumes a startling character
when romance in the form of mystic writings, and jugglery
in the form of pretended communication with the
spirit-world demand our respect and serious attention,
by claiming to have a divine origin. But hallucination
of the human intellect, as we shall see, is not confined
to such remote visionary speculations, and it is not unimportant
to remark that in mathematics, as in physics,
and in other branches of investigation, there is a
singular persistency in upholding errors.</p>

<p>A contemporary astrologer, assuming the pseudonym
of Zadkiel, tauntingly observes in his preface to a
recent publication: "<i>This is the age of inquiry</i>; and
yet prejudice continues to press down her leaden foot
upon the neck of examination in this matter"&mdash;that is,
Astrology. Now with this reproof before us we hope
to discuss the subject with becoming propriety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>


<h3>ASTROLOGY.</h3>

<p>The splendour of the sun by day, the glories of the
firmament by night, together with the sublimity of all
celestial phenomena, attract alike the attention of the
most simple and the most intellectual among mankind.
The distance, the magnitude, and the grandeur
of the entire planetary system while exciting emotions
of awe, reverence, and devotion among the mass of the
human race, have at the same time been studied from
the earliest period of man's history to the present time
superstitiously by one class of observers, and scientifically
by another.</p>

<p>As the telescope was not invented before the 17th
century, it is evident that the study of Astronomy without
that instrument must previously have been pursued
under amazing difficulties; and we might have expected
that when first used by Galileo at Venice in
1609, its introduction would have been hailed without
a dissentient voice. Such, however, was not the fact,
according to Sir David Brewster,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The principal Professor of Philosophy at Padua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
resisted Galileo's repeated and urgent entreaties to
look at the moon and planets through his telescope;
and he even laboured to convince Cosmo de Medici,
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, that the satellites of Jupiter
could not possibly exist. Sizzi, an astronomer of
Florence, maintained that as there were only <i>seven</i>
apertures in the head&mdash;<i>two</i> eyes, <i>two</i> ears, <i>two</i> nostrils,
and <i>one</i> mouth&mdash;and as there were only <i>seven</i> metals,
and <i>seven</i> days in the week, so there could only be
<i>seven</i> planets. He seems (eventually), however, to
have admitted the visibility of the four satellites through
the telescope; but he argues, that as they are invisible
to the naked eye, they can exercise no influence on the
earth; and being useless they do not exist."</p>

<p>Such being the crude state of astronomical science in
the 17th century, it must have been comparatively
imperfect throughout all preceding centuries; and
open to mystical appropriation and abuse by Egyptians,
Chaldeans, Hindus, Chinese, and European and other
ancient astrologers. Among that motley group the
most learned were found strangely associated with
ignorant impostors, and their activity in writing and
travelling served to spread their different systems over
the entire civilized world. It was not until late in the
17th century that Astrology could be absolutely de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>clared
to be in its decline. In England, William
Lilly, the Sidrophel of Hudibras, and the most famous
astrologer of his time, died in 1681, leaving behind
him his <i>Introduction to Astrology</i>, together with many
other works of the same character.</p>

<p>Astrology is merely a philosophism, being empirical,
wholly visionary, a mere fanciful system compounded
of incongruous mixtures of astronomical with human
events, of mythology with theology, and of facts with
pure fiction. It has been variously designated Judicial,
Hororary, Atmospherical, and Mundane, Astrology.
It has also many off-shoots subservient to Magic or the
black art, Sorcery, Witchcraft, and other pretended
mysticisms ostentatiously styled occult philosophy.</p>

<p>We may first observe that Astrology lays no claim to
inspiration, but affects a very ancient unknown origin,
tracing back to a dark, heathenish, and superstitious
age, in the very infancy of traditional knowledge, when
the boldest assertions of the seer were received as the
authority of an oracle, no one daring to question their
validity. Whatever is remotely possible the Astrologer
accepts as a fact; while ignorant of much around him,
he assumes with the utmost complacency an intimate
acquaintance with the sun and planets thousands upon
thousands of miles off; yea with the sun 969,272 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in diameter, while he himself inhabits a globe only
7,916 miles in diameter; from which the moon is
237,000 miles distant, and the sun 400 times that
distance.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And these immense bodies revolving millions
on millions of miles away in immeasurable space
are described by him as fashioning an infant's nose,
directing the fortunes or misfortunes of lovers, ordering
the property of traders, meting out diseases, and improving
or deranging man's mental faculties. And
as if such puerile influences were not sufficiently preposterous
we are informed by the modern seer, Zadkiel,
that the 12 signs of the Zodiac not only rule the several
parts of the human frame, but also those of a ship, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<i>Aries</i>, the bows; <i>Taurus</i>, the cutwater; <i>Gemini</i>, the
rudder; <i>Cancer</i>, the bottom; <i>Leo</i>, the upper works;
<i>Virgo</i>, the hold; <i>Libra</i>, parts above the water's edge;
<i>Scorpio</i>, the seamen's berths; <i>Sagittarius</i>, the seamen;
<i>Capricorn</i>, the ends of the vessel; <i>Aquarius</i>, the
Captain; <i>Pisces</i>, the oars in galleys, the wheels in steam
vessels, and the sails in others; but these latter being
above water, we are left in doubt about the ruler of the
submerged screw propeller.</p>

<p>To show what a modicum of learning, and how trifling
an acquaintance with matters of natural philosophy
will serve the Astrologer, we will turn to a modern
treatise published in the year 1801, by Francis Barrett,
(styling himself a student of Natural and Occult
Philosophy) a quarto volume of upwards of 370 pages,
entitled, "The Magus, or Celestial Intelligencer,"
which affords a pretty clear insight into the nature of
the superstitions which from an ancient period even
to that date obtained credence and were popular with
the multitude.</p>

<p>Treating of the wonders of Natural Magic previous
to entering on the main topic of his treatise, he
adduces a few of what he conceives to be ordinary
matters of fact, assuring us that:&mdash;</p>

<p>If any one shall, with an entire new knife, cut asunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a lemon, using words expressive of hatred, contumely,
or dislike, against any individual, the absent party,
though at an unlimited distance, feels a certain inexpressible
and cutting anguish of the heart, together
with a cold chilliness, and failure throughout the body;&mdash;likewise
of living animals, if a live pigeon be cut
through the heart, it causes the heart of the party
intended, to be affected with a sudden failure;&mdash;likewise
fear is induced by suspending the magical image of
a man by a single thread;&mdash;also death and destruction
by means similar to these; and all these from a fatal
and magical sympathy.</p>

<p>The loadstone, (he observes), possesses an eminent
medical faculty against many violent and implacable
disorders;&mdash;the back of the loadstone, as it repulses
iron, so also it removes gout, swellings, rheum, &amp;c.
that is of the nature or quality of iron. Likewise the
wearing the loadstone eases and prevents the cramp,
and such like disorders and pains.</p>

<p>The influences of the stars appear to be as intimately
known to Astrologers as though they had walked
among, and carefully examined and fully realized their
occult properties, for example:&mdash;</p>

<p>In every work observe Mercury, for he is a messenger
between the higher gods and the infernal gods;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
when he goes to the good, he increases their goodness&mdash;when
to the bad, he hath influence on their wickedness.
It is an unfortunate sign or planet, when it is
by the aspect of Saturn or Mars especially, apposite
or quadrant, for these are the aspects of enmity; but a
conjunction, a trine, and a sextile aspect, are of friendship;
but yet if you do already behold it through a
trine, and the planet be received, it is accounted as
already conjoined. Now all planets are afraid of the
conjunction of the sun, rejoicing in the trine, and sextile
aspect thereof.</p>

<p>They say of the Sun and Moon:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Sun is the lord of all elementary virtues;&mdash;it
disposes even the very spirit and mind of men.</p>

<p>The Moon (says Barrett) measures the whole space
of the Zodiac in the time of 28 days, hence it is that
the wise men of the Indians, and most of the ancient
astrologers have granted 28 mansions to the Moon,
which, being fixed in the eighth sphere, do enjoy divers
names and properties, from the various signs and stars
which are contained in them; through which, while
the Moon wanders, it obtains many other powers
and virtues; but every one of these mansions, according
to the opinion of Abraham, contained twelve
degrees, and fifty-one minutes, and almost twenty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
seconds. In the first quarter of these mansions the 1st
conduces to discords and journies; the second to the
finding of treasures, and to the retaining of captives;
the 3rd to benefit sailors, huntsmen, and alchymists; the
4th the destruction and hindrances of buildings, fountains,
mills, gold mines, the flight of creeping things,
and begets discord; the 5th to help the return from a
journey, the instruction of scholars, and confirms
edifices, gives good health and good will; the 6th to
hunting and besieging towns, and revenge of princes,
destroying harvests and fruits, and hinders the operation
of the physician; the 7th to confirm gain and
friendship; is profitable to lovers, and destroys magistracies.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the remaining three quarters have
the characters of their several mansions allotted to
them with equal exactness, and of course indisputable
veracity also.</p>

<p>We have here a fair example of the arrogant assumptions
of ancient and indeed of all astrologers, magicians,
and sorcerers, men who are incompetent to elucidate the
ordinary phenomena of nature in the animal or vegetable
creation, and yet with unbounded effrontery affect
to build up an empirical system, delivered in a language
of their own invention, a pompous parade of jargon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
made up of the most incomprehensible materials&mdash;which
if wholly due to antiquity partakes of ancient simplicity,
credulity, deceit, and superstition; and if somewhat
polished and refined to suit the advances of literature
and science, has never been able to prove the correctness
of its groundwork, or afford a solitary instance
of its possessing any meritorious quality beneficial to
mankind; while on the other hand its evil consequences
have been many, by destroying the peace and
happiness of thousands, encouraging deceit, and misapplying
in its ignoble pursuit the time and labour
and property of its ardent but deluded admirers.</p>

<p>In Judicial Astrology it is not thought requisite to
consider more than a certain number of the planets, after
a method simplified by antient astrologers or astronomers,
which is found to be so compact and so complete
in governing the destinies of the human race that
modern intelligence has failed to enlarge the field of
heavenly influences. Varley notes that:&mdash;the antients
discovered that the circle of the Zodiac, about 16 degrees
in width, and through the middle of which runs
the Ecliptic, or sun's path through the 12 signs, contains
the heavenly bodies, named planets, and the principal
fixed stars, and nearly the whole of the materials
or significators, from which predictions are obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>He remarks that:&mdash;In forming a horoscope, this
circle is divided into 12 equal parts, corresponding with
the spaces containing the 12 hours. These 12 divisions
are called houses; and they always remain fixed, while
the Zodiac with the 12 signs, and all the heavenly
bodies belonging to it, are considered to be moving
through them all, every 24 hours. The <i>lord</i> of the
ascendant is the planet which rules the signs rising at
birth. In drawing horoscopes it is usual to make the
figure square instead of round. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Plate_1">Plate 1</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>The various significations arising from the aspects of
the starry heavens at the time of birth are so exceedingly
numerous, that we must refer the curious in such
matters to the works themselves, in which all these
pretended revelations are minutely recorded.</p>

<p>Mankind rank astrologically as being of four temperaments.</p>

<p>1. One class is said to answer to the fiery trigon,
also called diurnal, masculine, and choleric, consisting
of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, which contains the
spirited, generous, magnanimous, and princely natures.</p>

<p>2. We have next the earthy trigon, being nocturnal,
feminine, and melancholic, consisting of Taurus, Virgo,
and Capricorn, containing the careful, sordid, and
penurious qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Thirdly, the aërial trigon, which is diurnal, masculine,
and sanguine, consisting of Gemini, Libra, and
Aquarius, contains the humane harmonies, and courteous
principles. And&mdash;</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, the watery trigon, which is nocturnal,
feminine, and phlegmatic; namely, Cancer, Scorpio,
and Pisces, including the cold, prolific, cautious and
severe qualities.</p>

<p>Take as a brief illustration of the manner in which
Astrologers presumptuously assign to the planets their
several offices relating to human nature the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those born when Aries ascends are born under
the sign Aries and planet Mars. This is the diurnal,
fair, and masculine house of Mars, and partakes also
largely of the nature of the magnanimous Sun, and
the benevolent and moral Jupiter, who rule the fiery
trigon, of which Aries is the first sign.</p>

<p>As affecting physiognomy we are assured that:</p>

<p>The Scorpio noses are more aquiline than those of
Aries, and are more frequently conspicuous for a sort
of bracket shape beneath, which prevents the under
part of the nose from forming a right angle with the
upper lip; while the under lip, both being usually
small, recedes in a greater degree, as if drawn tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
against the teeth; so that the mouth appears in the act
of pronouncing the word <span class="smcap">SEVERE</span>.</p>

<p>When we meet in volume after volume with page
after page of such composition as this, when we reflect
on the sublimity of the heavens and the paltriness of
such combinations as are here given of the planets with
mundane affairs, we ask the reasons for arriving at such
judgments. To be told that it is so because it is so;
or because it was an ancient belief, and is to be found
in the writings of Ptolemy, Nostradamus, Dr. John
Dee, William Lilly, or Zadkiel; or because it has
often proved as true in its predictions as the telling
fortunes by means of a pack of cards, is no evidence
whatever; yet the Astrologer boasts of his very paralogisms.</p>

<p>Zadkiel, in prefacing a work by Lilly, says:&mdash;If a
proposition of <i>any nature</i> be made to any individual,
about the result of which he is anxious, and, therefore,
uncertain whether to accede to it or not, let him but
note the hour and minute when it was <i>first</i> made, and
erect a figure of the heavens, (<i>See</i> <a href="#Plate_1">Plate 1</a>, Fig. 1,)&mdash;and
his doubts will be instantly resolved. He may
thus, in five minutes, learn infallibly whether the affair
will succeed or not; and, consequently, whether it is
prudent to adopt the offer made or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the belief of this sound, intelligent man, as
we fully believe him to be in other respects. But we
say it is not given to man to assign special influences
to the stars, to select one portion and discard all the
rest, or to be more intimately acquainted with the
starry heavens above him, than with the stony earth
he inhabits, and with his fellow creatures around him.</p>

<p>The works claiming to expound this pretended
Occult Philosophy prescribe such childish processes
that one naturally wonders how in the midst of so
much impudent imposture Astrology and its kindred
pursuits ever found or retained any honest partizans.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the use of fumigations, such as of
frankincense, &amp;c. to Saturn; of cloves, &amp;c. to Jupiter;
of odoriferous woods to Mars; of all gums to the
Sun; of roses, violets, &amp;c. to Venus; of cinnamon, &amp;c.
to Mercury; of the leaves of vegetables to the Moon;
of all or any of which there must be a good perfume,
odoriferous, and precious, in good matters; but in evil
ones quite the contrary.</p>

<p>The Zodiac is also favourably affected by proper
suffumigations.</p>

<p>Astrologers in their Demonology profess to be able
to ascertain the characters and seals of spirits,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
according to the Cabalists, tables are given of many of
these in their books, in the so-called Theban Alphabet;
in characters of Celestial Writing; in that
called Mallachim; or in the writing called Passing the
River.</p>

<p>They affect to have suitable bonds by which spirits
can be bound, invoked, or cast out.</p>

<p>Of Necromancy they pretend to two kinds, one of
which is raising the body of a deceased person, which
it is said cannot be done without blood;&mdash;the other
sciomancy, which is the production of a mere shade or
shadow.</p>

<p>The exorcisms and conjurations of Magicians are so
audaciously profane and blasphemous as to be unworthy
of even a passing notice.</p>


<h3>ALCHEMY.</h3>

<p>We shall now proceed to consider Alchemy, another
but very different chimerical pursuit, which was early
cultivated in the East, and is generally ascribed to
Hermes Trismegistus, although its more enthusiastic
admirers pretend to trace a knowledge of it to Adam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
From the earliest periods of history man was acquainted
with gold, silver, and other metals, with bitumen,
sulphur, sea salt, sal-ammoniac, gums, and resins,
together with other varieties of substances and liquids
common to modern chemistry. For the compounding
and heating of certain of these materials a multiplicity
of means were adopted requiring furnaces, crucibles,
and distillatory apparatus. The first workers in these
experimental operations formed a body of investigators
into the nature and properties of all manner of substances,
whether animal, vegetable or mineral, the
members of which were distinguished as adepts, alchemists,
and later in their career as common chemists.
The most esteemed branch of the art however was
Alchemy, a pseudo-science which ultimately took three
forms. First, the Hermetic Art for the discovery of
the Philosopher's stone; and the Alkahest, or universal
solvent;&mdash;Second, a Medical Alchemy;&mdash;and Third, a
Theological Alchemy pretending to conceal divine
mysteries under an allegorical form, treating of the
spiritual while apparently describing alchemical discoveries.</p>

<p>Our principal business, however, is with the so-called
Hermetic Philosophy, treating of vaunted methods of
transmuting the base metals into gold. It is doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
whether this particular delusion of the adepts can be
referred to a date earlier than the 8th century, but even
then we cannot refrain from surprise at the fallibility of
the human intellect, which could be swayed by a belief
in the pretended <i>lapis philosophorum</i> for upwards of ten
centuries. It was believed to be so secret and rare
that its possession was never ascribed at any time to
more than two or three favourite adepts, who transmitted
it to some single favoured individual after his
taking the sacrament, and going through certain prescribed
religious ceremonies, preparatory to being entrusted
with a verbal recipe for the composition of a
peculiar smelling red powder, of which it was affirmed
that when projected on heated mercury or any solid
metal, it would at once change it into pure gold. Ashmole
gravely assures us that Dr. John Dee and his associate
Kelly, having in some way procured this precious
substance, Kelly&mdash;to use Ashmole's own words&mdash;"made
projection with one small grain thereof, in proportion no
bigger than the least grain of sand, upon one ounce and
a quarter of common mercury, and it produced almost an
ounce of pure gold." With equal simplicity and earnestness,
Ashmole asserts that this same Kelly was often
seen to make these extraordinary transmutations,&mdash;"and
in particular (he adds) upon a piece of metal cut out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a warming-pan, and without touching or handling it, or
melting the metal, only warming it in the fire, the
elixir being put thereon, it was transmuted into pure
silver. The warming-pan and this piece of it, was sent
to Queen Elizabeth by her Ambassador who then lay
at Prague, that by fitting the piece into the place
whence it was cut, it might exactly appear to be once
part of the warming-pan."</p>

<p>Among the adepts there were no doubt a select few
who employed themselves in their prolonged labours
in all sincerity, and who were not unfrequently repaid
with remarkable, and unexpected results. Brass, being
the result of copper combined with zinc, would appear a
singular transformation. Many stones, or more properly,
ores, would yield sulphur and metals; sulphur
would be found apparently to dissolve iron; and
certain salts, when distilled, would yield corrosive
acids. Alchemy thus presented to the ancient adepts
many of the ordinary wonders of modern chemistry;
in short, the latest adept of the present century is no
other than an unlettered chemist. It was peculiar to
the Alchemists to treat all their operations as secrets;
which, when recorded, were described partly by
symbols and partly in a novel nomenclature, invented
to conceal their mysteries from vulgar gaze or imitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Thus, to prepare the philosopher's stone, we have
merely to&mdash;"Take of moisture, an ounce and a half;
of meridional redness, that is the soul of the sun, a
fourth part, that is, half an ounce; of yellow seyr,
likewise half an ounce; and of auripigmentum, a half
ounce; making in all three ounces. Know that the
vine of wise men is extracted in threes, and its wine
at last is completed in thirty." To the incredulous in
these matters, Ashmole offers the admonition that, he
knows "<i>Incredulity is given to the world as a punishment!</i>"
However, when the Alkahest, or pretended
Universal Solvent, was alluded to by the modern
chemist Kunckel, he could not refrain from incredulously
enquiring&mdash;"If it dissolves all substances, in
what vessel can it be contained?"</p>

<p>Alchemical writings are very numerous, it might be
impossible to procure a complete bibliographical list of
them, but they may be estimated at from 3000 to 4000
works, and an astonishing number of manuscripts.
Their authors indulge in such terms as the Ph[oe]nix,
to indicate the quintessence of Fire; Realgar, for the
fume of minerals; Guma, also Luna Compacta, for
quicksilver; Hadid, for iron; Aurum potabile, for
liquor of gold; Anathron, for saltpetre; Malek, for
salt; Terra fidelis, for silver; Tinkar, for borax; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in a similar strain for all matters and operations;
so that Dr. Johnson was justified in deriving the word
Gibberish from the mysterious jargon employed by
Geber, a celebrated Alchemist; who has, nevertheless,
been appropriately styled the Pliny of the 8th century.</p>

<p>Weidenfeld, in an Alchemical Treatise, published in
1685, addressing students, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Under heaven is not such an art, more promoting the
honour of God, more conducing to mankind, and more
narrowly searching into the most profound secrets of
nature, than is our true and more than laudable Chymy."</p>

<p>And at the conclusion of his address he observes:</p>

<p>"Nothing remains but upon our bended knees to
return most humble thanks to the Father of Lights,
in vouchsafing us this art by the writings of his
servants, and the high priests of Nature; without
which, it would be beyond the power of man to arrive
at so great a degree of knowledge."</p>

<p>Some notion of the extravagance of the language
employed may be obtained from his description of a
Philosophical Wine, literally, rectified spirits of wine,
or alcohol. He assures us that, on opening a vessel
of it, "a wonderful scent" should arise: "so as that
no fragrancy of the world can be compared to it;
inasmuch as putting the vessel to a corner of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
it can by an invisible miracle draw all that pass in to
it; or, the vessel being put upon a tower, draws all
birds within the reach of its scent, so as to cause them
to stand about it. Then will you have, my son, our
quintessence, which is otherwise called Vegetable
Mercury, at your will, to apply in Magistery of the
transmutation of metals."</p>

<p>How ardent an adept this Alchemist was may be
gathered from his exclamation:&mdash;"May the God of
Heaven put prudence in the heart of evangelical men,
for whom I compose this book, not to communicate
this venerable secret of God to the reprobates."</p>

<p>Among the remarkable discoveries made by Alchemists,
due to the carefully noted and carefully examined
failures and accidents, as well as successes, of their
endless combinations of matter, under the treatment
of fire and water, the most distinguished is that of
gunpowder, noted in a recipe left on record by Roger
Bacon, who died in the year 1284. He clearly names
the mixture of Saltpetre with Sulphur, but the third
ingredient, Carbon, is concealed in the form of an
anagram.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon, Luther, Spinoza, Leibnitz, and many
eminent moderns, were impressed with a belief in the
possibility of transmuting lead, tin, copper, or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
metals, into gold; in short, as it was supposed there
were only four elements, fire, water, earth, and air,
it was probably assumed that a fifth might be found
in the Philosopher's stone.</p>

<p>But if ever any pursuit was more open to fraudulent
practices than another, surely the pretended possession
of a transmuting powder or elixir afforded a
grand arena for their exercise. In this enlightened
age, although we cannot fail to look with charity on
the arduous labours of those adepts who honestly mixed
devotional exercises with laborious experimental operations,
selecting times and seasons for their alchemical
work, and noting with accuracy the hours and days of
fusions, sublimations, distillations, lixiviations, and so
forth; still, it is scarcely possible to refrain from
smiling at the docile simplicity of Ashmole in denouncing
a certain class of Alchemists, as pretended
masters and adepts, seeing "they are mere practisers of
legerdemain," while he himself gave credence to the
story of the warming-pan, already named as being
shown to Queen Elizabeth, which was clearly a flagrant
piece of fraud practised by Kelly, a common adventurer,
and from his youth remarkable only for his indifferent
character.</p>

<p>An easily performed trick was effected by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
nails, or other light articles, made half of gold and half
iron, but disguised, so as to appear to be of one metal
and colour. Sometimes these knaves employed crucibles,
having an interior false bottom, below which a small
quantity of gold was placed, which, being reproduced,
as was pretended from base materials, was offered as
an example of success. Or, by having the gold in a
hollow rod, stopped at one end with wax, used to stir
up the materials, the gold would naturally enough
appear in the crucible. Or, their materials being
conveyed into charcoal, a similar result would be
obtained on heating the crucible in a furnace. At other
times, by the employment of amalgams, or solutions
in acids, they could perform a species of electro-plating
on common metals. The extent to which these
nefarious practices were carried might appear incredible,
considering the evident inconsistency of the owner of
the pretended golden key to countless wealth, being in
such comparative poverty as to be indebted to any one
of moderate means for pecuniary assistance. But, it is
some apology for such credulity when we call to mind
the state of public morals, of education, of political
institutions, and the prevalent superstition, not only
among common people, but also the higher classes
of all countries and creeds, down to the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
century: representing a phase of the human mind,
liable to be overawed by impostors, who boldly claimed
supernatural aid in abetting their impositions. And
the trickery of the designing was further aided by
the close secrecy adopted by the adepts in their
processes, their conversations, and their writings.
Ashmole freely admits that&mdash;"Their chief study was
to wrap up their secrets in fables, and spin out their
fancies in 'vailes' and shadows, whose radii seem to
extend every way, yet so that all meet in a common
centre, and point only to one thing." It was this very
secrecy, this continual mystery from beginning to end,
that favoured deceptions of the grossest and most
bungling character, as viewed by the light of modern
chemistry.</p>

<p>Alchemy no doubt tended to improve Medical
science, by the introduction of many new mineral
and vegetable preparations, but the healing art treated
after the manner of the Hermetic Art, was laid open
to every description of quackery. It is not our intention,
however, to enlarge on this department, which
has steadily advanced at every stage of improvement
in chemical science.</p>

<h3>SQUARING THE CIRCLE.</h3>

<p>Of Mathematical Problems, the most perplexing to
ancient and modern mathematicians, although of late
years said to be satisfactorily demonstrated, and no
longer desiderata of Geometry, are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Quadrature or Squaring of the Circle;&mdash;2.
The Duplication, or doubling of the Cube;&mdash;and
3. The Trisection of the Angle.</p>

<p>In his "Popular Astronomy,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Professor Arago,
treating on the surface of a circle, observes that,&mdash;</p>

<p>It is mathematically equal to the product of the
length of the circumference, multiplied by half the
radius. To square a circle of a given diameter in
mètres, is the same as giving the number of squares,
of a mètre in each side, of which the surface is the
equivalent. If, the diameter being given, the exact
circumference were known by a sort of inspiration,
the superficial extent of the circular space would be
deducible from the two numbers, by the mere multiplication
of the numerical length of the circumference
by the fourth of the diameter, or half the radius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
But, the circumference being deducible from the
diameter only by approximation, the surface alluded to
cannot be computed with mathematical rigour; yet
the result can be obtained with all desirable precision
by the aid of the ratios usually given for such purpose;
for instance, the area of the space included within a
circle of thirty-eight millions of leagues radius, may
be determined within such a degree of precision that
the probable error shall not exceed the space of a
mite.</p>

<p>"The sect of squarers then," Arago adds,&mdash;"are
searching after a solution which is proved to be impossible,
and which, moreover, would be of no practical
use, even if their foolish hopes were crowned with
success."</p>

<p>In the "Birds" of Aristophanes, the character is
introduced of a geometer, who is going to make a
square circle, showing how early this chimerical performance
became an object of ridicule.</p>

<p>Thales, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Plato,
Apollonius, Ptolemy, with other ancient mathematicians,
have given methods for approximating to the area of
the circle; and many also among the moderns. In
1775, the Paris Academy of Science determined to discourage
papers devoted to this subject, and their course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in this respect was soon after adopted also by The
Royal Society, it being found that there was among
certain geometers a complete mania for settling this
and similar problems, the solution of which was either
unattainable, or if attained of very questionable value.</p>


<h3>DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE.</h3>

<p>The Duplication of the Cube it is asserted can readily
be demonstrated. It is usually called the Delian Problem,
from its having been suggested by the oracle of
Apollo at Delphos, requiring that Apollo's cubical
altar should be doubled.</p>

<p>It is something in its favour to say that the enquiry
has had the attention of Newton and of Huygens.</p>


<h3>TRISECTION OF AN ANGLE.</h3>

<p>Lastly, we shall notice among problems of this class&mdash;the
Trisection of an Angle, which it is asserted can
only be accomplished by means of the conic sections
and some other curves.</p>

<p>A rule for the cubic equation by which the problem
of trisection is solved has been given by Cardan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty only arises when we attempt the trisection
of any other than a right angle, its trisection
being easily effected with a pair of compasses.</p>

<p>On this subject it has been observed that, "there is
no more trouble in trisecting an angle, not a right
angle, than in finding a cube root."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These three celebrated problems have received the
attention of mathematicians in every age and country,
and led to many learned discussions, and controversial
writings. But in point of litigiousness the Squarers of
the Circle most decidedly carry off the palm, having
frequently laid and lost heavy wagers, and even appeared
in a Court of Justice to settle their monetary disputes.
They are renowned for their pamphlets, in which philosophers
of every class are charged with prejudice, conceit,
and ignorance, and denounced for their want of
candour and consistency in not giving audience to the
projector of the last best demonstration.</p>


<h3>PERPETUUM MOBILE.</h3>

<p>To conclude this Lecture we shall offer a few remarks
on Perpetuum Mobile, or the search for a means of obtaining
a mechanical perpetual motion. As a mathema<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>tical
problem it dates back some 2000 years or more,
but we know nothing of any actual attempt earlier than
the 14th century to construct a machine intended to be
self motive, by containing within itself the means of
continually overbalancing. External motive agency
such as the tides, magnetism, and the like are not
included; the only admitted agent being gravity.</p>

<p>If we considered wear and tear the question would be
settled at once, but this is allowed as the single exception,
and therefore any machine constantly renewing
the means that first moved it might be deservedly
called a perpetual motion.</p>

<p>Until a history of the schemes invented by numerous
ingenious mechanics was published in 1861, inventors
of this class were continually though unconsciously
reproducing obsolete contrivances, from taking up
the ordinary idea that a wheel may be kept constantly
over-weighted on one side, so as to raise the next
weight which is to perform the same miracle of art. It
is singular to observe this particular coincidence of the
inventive faculty of man, and it shows next to a demonstration,
that if all mechanical inventions were
swept from the face of the earth they would be reproduced
in some remote age.</p>

<p>A common error with those who toil at perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
motion machinery is their aiming to produce a bottled-up
power; or to apply the principles of the ordinary
scale or balance to a wheel, overlooking the simple
facts of friction on one side acting against their
most ingenious contrivances, and of non-production on
the other. Sooner or later, however, they discover the
inertia of matter, that a pound will not raise a pound,
and that they cannot invent mechanism to move independently
of the laws of action and reaction.</p>

<p>A ball descending a semicircular path, as suggested
by Dr. Henderson, will only rise to the same height as
that from which it fell; and will afterwards gradually
diminish in velocity until it rests at the centre. If it
would ascend to a height greater than that from
which it descended, then indeed an inclined path
might return the ball to repeat such evolutions until
quite worn out.</p>

<p>And as regards the weighted wheels, it is always
overlooked that they come to rest from the same fact,
that the vertical line of descent and that of ascent are
equal, however much the weights may on one side
recede from the centre, while on the other side the
weights are approaching the centre. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Plate_6">Plate 6</a>,
Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>The most famous perpetual motive schemes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
those of the Marquis of Worcester made 1630-41; (<i>See</i>
<a href="#Plate_6">Plate 6</a>, Fig. 2,) and of Bessler, better known as
Orfyreus, between 1712-19.</p>

<p>The Marquis gives a brief notice of his plan, in his
"Century of Inventions," a curious catalogue of his
several ingenious schemes.</p>

<p>But of Orfyreus's wheel we know nothing more than
was communicated by the eminent mathematician,
'S Gravesande, to Sir Isaac Newton, after an external
view of it, while it was rotating in a chamber of the
residence of the Prince of Hesse Cassel.</p>

<p>The most singular part of this strange delusion is
the fact of its strong hold on the minds of its infatuated
votaries. Once bewitched with the idea of at last
succeeding in the attainment of his grand design,
fortune, health, and reputation, are resolutely set at
nought, in the delirium of delight that follows; and
more unreasonable creatures can scarcely be found
than such self-deluded individuals, for they cannot,
or will not, be convinced that their utmost efforts can
at best but produce an amazingly curious toy; and
nothing can be more futile than to expect any higher
application, assuming such a discovery were possible.</p>

<p>The best proof of the sincerity and earnestness of
those who seek the attainment of a mechanical perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
motion, is afforded by the variety and number of their
patented schemes; the patentees having among them
divines, doctors, lawyers, civil engineers, carpenters,
draughtsmen, jewellers, watchmakers, shoemakers,
confectioners, and all classes of professions and trades.
It is not, as is generally supposed, only the wholly
ignorant and designing who can be cajoled by these
chimeras; there is in them a spice of mystery, of
wonder, of singularity, and of simplicity combined with
much subtle difficulty, which, being once fully imbibed,
acts like an opiate draught.</p>

<p>We have thus reviewed summarily, chimeras which
are mainly associated with Astronomy, Chemistry,
Mathematics, and Mechanics, and which have swayed
the human mind more or less from a period anterior to
the Christian era. The list of this species of deceitful
systems of pseudo-philosophy, and of profitless problems,
might have been enlarged; but what has been
advanced may suffice as a warning to the uninitiated
to beware of blind guides and of visionary pursuits.
Science has lost nothing by its professors exercising
that degree of caution, which all classes of superficially
learned men, affecting to possess original and
valuable views on certain matters, call <i>prejudice</i>: which,
in such cases, generally means no more than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
natural aversion which the learned have for all attempts
to place specious dogmas on a level with sound
science. Such enthusiasts are generally men of no research
or depth of thought, who obtain an imperfect
acquaintance with subjects with which they are incompetent
to grapple; and with whom it is, therefore,
hopeless to contend. Delusion will have its day, and
will as certainly decay, if not die out. Chimeras constantly
spring up, and find ardent professors and
crowds of easily led proselytes, even up to this very
present time; so that although, undoubtedly with many&mdash;<i>Knowledge
is power</i>: yet it is to be feared that far too
large a proportion of mankind favour the delusion that&mdash;<i>Ignorance
is bliss</i>.</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS OF THE PLATES.</h3>


<h4>
<a id="Plate_1_ex"></a>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_1">Plate I.&mdash;Figure 1.</a></span></h4>

<p><i>Of the Twelve Houses.</i>&mdash;The 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th
houses&mdash;<i>angular</i>.&mdash;These are of more durable signification
than the others, denoting the wife or husband&mdash;a situation
under Government, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The twelve houses have signification of all the various
concerns of human life, and of nature at large.</p>

<p><i>For Example.</i>&mdash;When the cusp of the first house is well
aspected by, or has the presence of Jupiter or Venus, and
these are not afflicted by the aspects of evil planets, they
preserve life in infancy, and give health, and often an
agreeable person.</p>

<p>But if their rays or presence (says Varley) should be
thrown on the cusp of the second house, then the native
will have success in concerns of property. The Sun in
this house helps to disperse property; and if he be peregrine,
that is, in the sign of a contrary nature to his own,
where he has no dignities, and is without reception, then the
native's property is dispersed in vainglorious expenses;
but if the Sun be in Leo, his property in general will
be ample enough to admit of instant acts of bounty and
benevolence.</p>

<p>In a similar strain, Astronomers particularize the remaining
eleven houses. It would be impossible, in any
reasonable space, to describe further the operations of the
planets in the several houses thus assigned to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>As to when the Planets are most powerful.</i>&mdash;Barrett
says:&mdash;The planets are powerful when they are ruling in a
house, or in exaltation, or triplicity, or term, or face,
without combustion of what is direct in the figure of the
heavens; but we must take care that they are not in the
bounds or under the dominion of Saturn or Mars. The
angles of the ascendant, and 10th and 7th are fortunate;
as also the lord of the ascendant, and place of the Sun and
Moon.</p>

<p>The Moon is powerful if she be in her house, in exaltation,
in triplicity, in face, or in degree convenient for the
desired work, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<a id="Plate_2_ex"></a>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_2">Plate II.</a></span></h4>

<p>This table gives the usual symbols employed for indicating
the several planets, and which are still retained in
Astronomy for simplicity of expression, but which Astrologers
venerate as possessing a cabalistic character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Associated with these symbols are the names of certain
principal angels, spirits, or demons, forming, however, but
a small proportion of such airy nothings.</p>

<p>The Astrological Symbols were also employed by the
Alchemists to indicate the seven metals then known.</p>


<h4>
<a id="Plate_3_ex"></a>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_3">Plate III.</a>&mdash;Squaring the Circle.</span></h4>

<p>Mr. James Smith, of Liverpool, the most laborious
among recent workers in this field of enquiry, claiming to
have propounded several simple and exact methods, offers
the following as sufficiently demonstrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>I construct my diagrams in the following way:&mdash;I draw
two straight lines at right angles, making O the right angle.
From the point O, in the direction OA, I mark off four
equal parts together equal to OA, and from O, in the direction
of OB, I mark off three of such equal parts together, equal
to OB, and join AB. It is obvious, or rather self-evident,
that AOB is a right-angled triangle, of which the sides
that contain the right angle are in the ratio of 4 to 3, by
construction. With A as centre and AB as interval, I
describe the circle X, produce AO and BO to meet and
terminate in the circumference of the circle at the points
G and C, and join AC, CG, and BG, producing the quadrilateral
ACGB. I bisect AG at F, and with O as
centre, and OF as interval, describe the circle Z. The line
OF is the line that joins the middle points of the diagonals
in the quadrilateral ACGB; and it follows that,</p>

<p>{AG<sup>2</sup> + CB<sup>2</sup> + 4(OF<sup>2</sup>)} = {AC<sup>2</sup> + CG<sup>2</sup> + BG<sup>2</sup> + AB<sup>2</sup>.}</p>

<p>When AO = 4, we get the following equation:&mdash;</p>

<p>{5<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup> + (4 × 1'5<sup>2</sup>)} = {5<sup>2</sup> + sqrt(10<sup>2</sup>) + sqrt(10<sup>2</sup>) + 5<sup>2</sup>,}
or, {25 + 36 + <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>9}={25 + 10 + 10 + 25} = 70. From the points B and C, I
draw straight lines at right angles to AB and AC, and therefore
tangential to the circle X, to meet AG produced at D,
and join BD and CD, producing the quadrilateral ACDB.
I bisect AD at E, and with O as centre, and EO as interval
describe the circle XY, and with E as centre, and EA or
ED as interval describe the circle Y.</p>

<p>Now, to square the circle, or, in other words, to get
exactly equal in superficial area to the circle X, I will show
how to find it. From the point G draw a straight line&mdash;say
G <i>m</i>&mdash;perpendicular to ED, making G <i>m</i> equal
GD. Produce GA to a point <i>n</i>, making G <i>n</i> equal to
2AG - GD, and join <i>n m</i>. The square on <i>n m</i> will be
the required square. (I have indicated this square by dotted
lines.) For example:&mdash;If AO = 4, then AG = 5, and GD
= 1'25; therefore {2 AG - GD} = {10 - 1'25} = 8'75 =
Gn: and Gm = 1'25; therefore, Gn<sup>2</sup> + Gm<sup>2</sup> = 3-1/8 (AB<sup>2</sup>);
that is, {8'75<sup>2</sup> + 1'25<sup>2</sup>} = 3-1/8 (5<sup>2</sup>), or, {76'5625 + 1'5625} =
{3'125 × 25};
and this equation=Area of the Circle X;
and area of the square on <i>n m</i> :: and it follows, that the area
of every circle, is equal to the area of a square on the hypotenuse
of a right-angled triangle, of which the sides that
contain the right angle are in the ratio of 7 to 1, and the sum
of these two sides equal to the diameter of the circle. In
many ways I have proved this fact, by practical or constructive
geometry.</p>


<h4>
<a id="Plate_4_ex"></a>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_4">Plate IV.</a></span></h4>

<p><i>Duplication of the Cube.</i>&mdash;In his "Young Geometrician;
or, Practical Geometry without Compasses," 1865,
Mr. Oliver Byrne's 40th Problem is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Let AB be the side of a given cube BD. It is required
to find AC, the side of another cube CE, so that the solid
contents of the cube CE are double the solid contents of
the cube BD.</p>

<p>Ancient and modern mathematicians (says Mr. Byrne)
have in vain attempted to solve this problem geometrically,
that is, by the ruler and compasses only.</p>

<p>Let AB = BG = GR = RQ = QP = QO = OR = VZ. The
length of the shortest side of the lesser set square; a line of
any other given length may be applied. Draw OP and VR
parallel to it; then apply the set squares in close contact,
the edge OV of OVT passing through the point O, while
the points of V and Z of ZSV fall exactly on the lines RV,
RZ. Then draw the line ZBC, cutting FA produced in C;
then the cube on AC is double the cube on AB.</p>


<h4>
<a id="Plate_5_ex"></a>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_5">Plate V.</a></span></h4>

<p><i>Trisection of an Angle.</i>&mdash;In his work entitled <i>Young
Geometrician</i>, 1865, Mr. Oliver Byrne gives as the 39th
Problem: To divide a given angle BAC into three equal
angles:&mdash;</p>

<p>The line A <i>m</i> is made = <i>p q</i>, the least side of the lesser
triangular ruler; by (II) <i>p m</i> is drawn parallel, and <i>m n</i>
perpendicular to AB. Then both rulers are kept in motion,
and at the same time in close contact, as represented in the
figure, until <i>p</i> falls on the line <i>p m</i>, and <i>n</i> on the line <i>m n</i>;
<i>r n</i>A passing through the angular point A.</p>

<p>Then the angle DAB is one-third of the angle CAB.
Mr. Byrne asserts that this problem is not capable of
solution by the straight line and circle. Mathematicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
have in vain attempted to solve it geometrically, that is, by
the ruler and compasses only.</p>


<h4>
<a id="Plate_6_ex"></a>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_6">Plate VI.&mdash;Figure 1.</a></span></h4>

<p><i>Perpetuum Mobile.</i> Desaguliers demonstrated the absurdity
of attempting to raise weights enclosed in a cellular
wheel, simply by providing for their approach in succession
nearer to the centre on the ascending side, while they should
be projected further from the centre on the descending
side. He remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those who think the velocity of the weight is the line it
describes, expect that that weight shall be overpoised, which
describes the shortest line, and therefore contrive machines
to cause the ascending weight to describe a shorter line than
the descending weight.</p>

<p>For example, in the circle A B D <i>a</i>, the weights A and B
being supposed equal, it is imagined that, if by any contrivance
whatever, whilst the weight A describes the arc A <i>a</i>,
the weight B is carried in any arc, as B <i>b</i>, so as to come
nearer the centre in its rising, than if it went up the arc
B D; the said weight shall be overpoised, and consequently,
by a number of such weights, a perpetual motion produced.</p>

<p>Now the velocity of any weight is <i>not</i> the line which
it describes in general, but the height that it rises up to, or
falls from, with respect to its distance from the centre of the
earth. So that when the weight describes the arc A <i>a</i>, its
velocity is the line A C, which shows the perpendicular
descent, and likewise the line B C denotes the velocity of
the weight B, or the height that it rises to, when it ascends
in any of the arcs B <i>b</i>, instead of the arc B D: so that, in
this case, whether the weight B, in its ascent be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
nearer the centre or not, it loses no velocity, which it ought
to do, in order to be raised up by the weight A.</p>

<p>Indeed, if the weight at B, could by any means spring as
it were, or be lifted up to <i>x</i>, and move in the arc <i>x b</i>, the end
would be answered, because then the velocity would be
diminished, and become <i>x</i>C.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a href="#Plate_6">Figure 2.</a></span></h4>

<p>In "The Life, Times, and Scientific Labours of the
Marquis of Worcester," 1865, page 454, will be found a
full account of the present diagram, which is intended to
illustrate as far as possible, an approach to the probable
construction of the wheel by the Marquis in the 56th article
of his memorable "Century of Inventions."</p>

<p>If any likely-looking method, could, more than another,
render hopelessness more hopeless, surely this mechanical
demonstration must prove most efficient for that purpose.
For here, we actually produce a wheel agreeing to the
terms with which Desaguliers closes his demonstration,
when he suggests the only likely method to effect the end
proposed, namely, perpetual motion. We find the fallen
weight is absolutely "lifted up" as he desires, and "moves
in the arc" he describes, and yet although he declares that
then "the end would be answered"&mdash;it absolutely is <i>not</i>
answered in this instance.</p>

<p>It is not requisite to calculate throughout the effect of
the Marquis's entire number of 40 weights; four will suffice,
taking the vertical and horizontal spokes <i>a a a a</i>, showing
two rings <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>; one, <i>b</i>, 12 inches within the other, so
that the wheel being, as the Marquis says, 14 feet diameter,
the inner ring will be 12 feet diameter. Now let each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
weight D be attached in the centre of a cord or chain <i>a</i>´, D, b´,
2 feet long, and then secure one end, as <i>a</i>´, so the extreme
end of each spoke <i>a</i>´, and the other end of the cord, as b´,
to place on one lesser ring, as at <i>b</i>, or 12 inches from each
spoke.</p>

<p>We shall then find by admeasurement that the upper
weight on the vertical spoke is 7 feet from the centre, and the
lower weight 6 feet; while at the same time there appears
to be a preponderance due to the superior length of the
horizontal arm A´; but against this latter we have the
rising weight <i>b</i>´D, 1 foot from the centre, which, added to
the 6 feet on the horizontal spoke, neutralizes the hoped-for
effect, and the wheel remains in <i>statu quo</i>.</p>

every eminent literary or scientific person of the time of the Commonwealth."&mdash;<i>The
Spectator</i>, 20th May.</p>

<p class="center">One Volume, post 8vo., with engravings, price 2<i>s</i>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="display-large">THE GHOST!</span><br /></p>

<p class="center">AS PRODUCED IN THE SPECTRE DRAMA,</p>

<p class="center">POPULARLY ILLUSTRATING THE MARVELLOUS OPTICAL ILLUSIONS
OBTAINED BY THE APPARATUS CALLED THE DIRCKSIAN
PHANTASMAGORIA.
</p>

<p>"Mr. Dircks gives us the benefit of all his progressive discoveries in
the matter, from the paper first read at the British Association Meeting
at Leeds, in 1858, to the more recent improvements, with full explanations
of the machinery, apparatus, and processes adopted in these ghost
dramas, and further favours the public with a number of new adaptations.
As a curious description of these spectral illustrations, the book is most
interesting."&mdash;<i>The Technologist</i>, January, 1864.</p>

<p>"A volume explanatory of the uncommonly clever and scientific
"spectral illusion" which has of late fairly turned the public head."&mdash;
<i>The Dublin Builder</i>, January 1.<br />
</p>

<p>"A few months ago all London was rushing off to see Professor
Pepper's Ghost, as it was called, but which it now appears was the property
of Mr. Dircks, and from which his good name was filched in a very
unhandsome manner. Here then he tells us all about it, how the spectre
was raised, and how we may ourselves at pleasure call spirits from the
vasty deep."&mdash;<i>The Bookseller</i>, February 29.</p>
